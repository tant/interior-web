# Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to practice and enhance web development skills by building a modern website using the latest technologies in the tech stack, including Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Headless UI, and Framer Motion. This project serves as a hands-on exercise to explore best practices and new features in these frameworks and libraries.

# Tailwind CSS v4 Highlights

This project uses Tailwind CSS v4, which introduces several improvements and changes:

- **Smaller and faster builds**: Tailwind v4 uses the new Oxide engine for faster compilation and smaller CSS output.
- **Updated default color palette**: The default color palette has been refreshed for better accessibility and modern aesthetics.
- **Simplified configuration**: The configuration file is now cleaner and easier to manage.
- **Improved dark mode**: Dark mode support is more flexible and easier to implement.
- **New utilities and features**: Includes new utility classes and improved support for CSS variables.

For more details, see the [Tailwind CSS v4 release notes](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
